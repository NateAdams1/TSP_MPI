# Traveling Salesman Problem

This Program is a Brute Force Approach to the [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). Although there exists better versions of this program done by [Concorde](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html), I used this to learn MPI and also understand TSP. There will be a regular serial version of this code, and a parallel version with MPI. This was done at the University of Montana for CSCI 491 Special Topics - HPC and run on The University of Montana Hellgate Cluster.
